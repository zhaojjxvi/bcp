## BCP snippet

main steps: 
1. export from the source server to the local disk
1. truncate the target table in target server
1. import from the local disk to the target server

caution: need to create the table with same table structures of the origin tables

I build this based on the script from my colleagues and enchanded the functions

Platform: VS Code
